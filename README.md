<h2>Sorting Algorithms</h2>
<h3>Bubble Sort</h3>
<p>Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), making it suitable for small datasets.</p>

<h3>Quick Sort</h3>
<p>Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions a list into two sub-lists and then sorts those sub-lists recursively. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n) on average, making it more efficient than Bubble Sort for larger datasets</p>

<h3>Trim Sort</h3>
<p>Tirm Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that iteratively partitions an array into two parts, one with elements smaller than a selected pivot, and one with elements larger than the pivot. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n) on average, making it efficient for larger datasets.</p>

<h2>Data Strucutures</h2>
<h3>Binary Search Tree</h3>
<p>A Binary Search Tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, and the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values in its left subtree and less than or equal to the values in its right subtree. This data structure is useful for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of elements, and has an average time complexity of O(log n) for these operations.</p>
